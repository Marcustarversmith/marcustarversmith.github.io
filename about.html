WHO ARE WE?
</h1>
</div>
<p>
SupporTeen Youth Inc. is a non-profit organized to help young people reach their fullest potential academically, socially, and personally through supportive mentorship. We believe in the saying it takes a village to raise a child, but in that it also takes a solid support system to create the village and that's what we are. We're that stable support system that will be that extra ear and voice for parents and youth. We will have many events and activities where young people can learn, grow and have fun with people striving towards the same goals. We connect with teachers and aid them in educating. We are at sporting events, recitals, birthdays and many other outings.
